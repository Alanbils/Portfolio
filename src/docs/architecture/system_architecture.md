# Data Engineering Platform Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the data engineering platform deployed on AWS.

## Overview

The data engineering platform provides a comprehensive solution for ingesting, processing, storing, and analyzing data at scale. It follows a modern data architecture pattern with clear separation of storage and compute, enabling cost-effective and scalable data processing.

## Key Components

### Data Ingestion

- **Streaming Ingestion**: AWS Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose for real-time data ingestion
- **Batch Ingestion**: AWS Transfer Family and direct S3 uploads for batch file processing
- **API Integration**: API Gateway and Lambda functions for application integration

### Data Storage

- **Data Lake**: S3-based data lake with three-tier architecture
  - **Raw Zone**: Immutable storage of raw data as received from sources
  - **Processed Zone**: Cleaned, validated, and transformed data in optimized formats
  - **Curated Zone**: Business-level, query-optimized datasets ready for consumption

- **Data Warehouse**: Amazon Redshift for high-performance analytics queries
  - **Staging Schema**: Intermediate tables for data loading and transformation
  - **Core Schema**: Dimensional models (facts and dimensions)
  - **Mart Schema**: Department-specific datasets and aggregates

### Data Processing

- **Batch Processing**: EMR clusters with Spark for large-scale data transformations
- **Stream Processing**: Kinesis Data Analytics and KCL applications for real-time analytics
- **Serverless Processing**: Lambda functions for event-driven transformations

### Metadata Management

- **Data Catalog**: AWS Glue Data Catalog for metadata storage and schema management
- **Data Lineage**: Custom tracking of data transformations and dependencies
- **Data Quality**: Automated validation and monitoring of data quality metrics

### Data Access and Consumption

- **Business Intelligence**: Integration with BI tools (e.g., QuickSight, Tableau)
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for programmatic data access
- **Ad-hoc Query**: Athena for SQL queries against data lake objects

## Data Flow

1. Data is ingested through batch uploads or streaming pipelines
2. Raw data is stored in the data lake's raw zone (S3)
3. Data is processed and validated:
   - Batch data through EMR/Spark jobs
   - Streaming data through Kinesis Analytics
4. Processed data is stored in the processed zone in optimized formats (Parquet)
5. Business transformations are applied using dbt in Redshift
6. Transformed data is made available to end-users through Redshift, Athena, or APIs

## Security Architecture

- **Network Security**: VPC with private subnets, security groups, and NACLs
- **Access Control**: IAM roles and policies based on least privilege principle
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest (S3, Redshift) and in transit (TLS)
- **Audit**: CloudTrail for API activity logging and S3 access logs

## Monitoring and Alerting

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics and alarms for AWS services
- **Data Pipeline Monitoring**: Custom metrics for data flow and quality
- **Alerting**: SNS notifications for critical issues
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs

## Deployment and Infrastructure

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- **Configuration Management**: Terragrunt for environment-specific configurations
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev, staging, and production environments
