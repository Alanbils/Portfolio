[Placeholder for architecture diagram]

Note: This file should be replaced with an actual PNG diagram.
For an actual implementation, you would create a diagram using tools like:
- Lucidchart
- draw.io
- AWS Architecture diagrams
- Miro

The diagram should visualize the complete data platform architecture including:
- Data ingestion flows (batch and streaming)
- Storage components (data lake, data warehouse)
- Processing components (EMR, Lambda, Kinesis)
- Access patterns (BI tools, APIs)
- Cross-cutting concerns (security, monitoring, governance)
